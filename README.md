# Data Analysis Project: The history of the modern Olympic Games
## üìñ Project Overview

Final project of the course **‚ÄúData Analysis with Python‚Äù** presented at the Salzburg University of Applied Sciences is shown here. Throughout the course we used various libraries and frameworks for evaluating different data, ending with this project which was presented in a special event at the university.

This dataset provides an opportunity to ask questions about how the Olympics have evolved over time, including questions about the participation and performance of women, different nations, and different sports and events. The goal is to present my findings and insights in a visual format using charts, graphs, or infographics.

**In this occasion, let me take you on a walk through the participation of Argentine women in the history of the Olympic Games :)**
